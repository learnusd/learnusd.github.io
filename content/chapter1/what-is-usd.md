USD stands for "Universal Scene Description" and at this point is an umbrella term that includes an open standard (https://openusd.org/) to collaboratively edit and create 3D scenes and assets, apply physically correct properties to the 3D assets, describe the materials to apply, define the hierarchies (e.g. which asset goes under which other asset to create the 3D model of a car), define how properties vary with time (e.g. for an animation of a 3D model) and much more.

Among other things the USD standard also describes a file format (.usd files) which defines how to save that information to a single or multiple files that can be shared with other users locally or across a network to collaborate on authoring (i.e. 'editing') and visualizing 3D scenes.

## Why having USD is important

There used to be no consensus among modeling softwares (e.g. Blender, 3D Studio Max or Maya) and programs operating on assets needed to compose 3D scenes (e.g. programs to aid in material designing like Adobe Substance Painter) on how to communicate with each other (especially if from different vendors). These programs are commonly referred to as _DCC tools_, i.e. "Digital Content Creator" tools.

USD aims at filling that gap and providing a single source of truth to exchange files seamlessly and let multiple people work on the same 3D scene/model at the same time.
